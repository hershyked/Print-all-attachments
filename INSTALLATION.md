1. **Extract the release files** to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\PrintAllAttachments\`)

   - Navigate to the extracted folder
   - Run the following command (adjust path as needed):
     ```cmd
     reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\PrintAllAttachments" /v "Description" /t REG_SZ /d "Print All Attachments Add-in" /f
     reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\PrintAllAttachments" /v "FriendlyName" /t REG_SZ /d "Print All Attachments" /f

     ```
   - **Note:** Replace `C:\Program Files\PrintAllAttachments\` with your actual installation path

3. **Trust the add-in location:**
