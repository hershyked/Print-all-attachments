## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Select Emails with Attachments

In your Outlook inbox or any mail folder:

- **Multiple emails**: 
  - Hold `Ctrl` and click on each email you want to select
  - OR: Click the first email, hold `Shift`, click the last email to select a range
  - OR: Use `Ctrl+A` to select all emails in the folder

**Tip**: Look for the paperclip icon üìé to identify emails with attachments.

### Step 2: Print Attachments

2. Find the **"Attachments"** group (it should be on the "Mail" tab)
3. Click the **"Print Attachments"** button

### Step 3: Review Results

After clicking the button:

1. The add-in will process all selected emails
2. For each email, it will extract and print all attachments

   - Number of emails processed
   - Number of attachments printed
   - Any errors that occurred

**Example output:**

```

## Understanding the Process

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Verify Your Printer

Before using the add-in:
- Make sure your printer is on and connected
- Check that it's set as the default printer
- Ensure it has paper and ink/toner

**To set default printer:**
1. Windows Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners
2. Select your printer
3. Click "Manage" > "Set as default"

### 2. Preview Before Printing

If you want to verify what will be printed:
1. Manually open one email
2. Save an attachment
3. Open it to see how it looks when printed
4. Then use the add-in for batch printing

### 3. Handle Large Batches

For many emails with attachments:
- **Select in smaller groups** - Process 10-20 emails at a time
- **Monitor printer queue** - Check Windows print spooler if needed
- **Wait between batches** - Give your printer time to process

### 4. Dealing with Different File Types

Some applications may briefly appear when printing:
- **PDF files**: Adobe Reader or default PDF viewer may flash
- **Office files**: Word/Excel may open briefly in the background
- **This is normal** - The application is processing the print job

### 5. Managing Print Settings

The add-in uses your default print settings. To adjust:

1. Open the file type in its native application
2. Go to Print settings (Ctrl+P)
3. Set your preferences (color, orientation, paper size)
4. Save as default for that application
5. These settings will be used when the add-in prints

## Common Scenarios

4. All PDFs print automatically

**Time saved**: Instead of 5 minutes of repetitive clicking, it takes 5 seconds!

### Scenario 2: Weekly Reports

**Problem**: Every Friday you need to print reports from multiple departments.

**Solution**:
1. Create a folder for weekly reports
2. Move all report emails to that folder
3. Select all emails in the folder
4. Click "Print Attachments"

### Scenario 3: Meeting Preparation

**Problem**: You need to print all meeting materials from various emails.

**Solution**:
1. Search for emails with a specific subject or date
2. Select relevant emails from the search results
3. Click "Print Attachments"
4. All meeting documents print together

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your workflow:

- `Ctrl+A` - Select all emails in current view
- `Ctrl+Click` - Add individual emails to selection
- `Shift+Click` - Select a range of emails
- `Alt` then arrow keys - Navigate ribbon with keyboard

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Nothing prints after clicking the button

**Check:**
- Is your printer turned on and connected?
- Do the emails actually have attachments?
- Did you get an error message?

### Some attachments didn't print

**Possible causes:**
- Unsupported file type (see [Supported File Types](#supported-file-types))
- Application not installed (e.g., trying to print .docx without Word)
- Printer ran out of paper mid-job

**Solution**: Check the summary dialog for specific errors.

### Application windows keep popping up

**This is normal** for some file types. The associated application needs to open the file to print it. The add-in tries to hide these windows, but some may briefly appear.

### Prints are going to the wrong printer

**Solution**: Set your desired printer as default:
1. Windows Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners
2. Select the printer you want
3. Click "Set as default"

### "Access Denied" or permission errors

**Causes:**
- Outlook security settings
- Antivirus blocking the add-in
- Corrupted temporary files

**Solutions:**
1. Add the add-in to your antivirus whitelist
2. Run Outlook as administrator (one time test)
3. Clear your Windows temp folder
